# SENTO - The Open SEN API

Like a Japanese hot bath, this is a place to exchange information freely, this one is for apps though:)

Contains API definitions to develop for SEN. Currently contains only C/C++ headers but support for other languages (think Python library) may be added later.

See the [SEN Substack](https://senlabs.substack.com/) and watch the [Twitter/X profile](https://x.com/labs_sen) for more information on the SEN project.
