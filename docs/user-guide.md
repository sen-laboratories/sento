## Relations in folders

A relation connects a file with another file: a book with its author, a PDF bookmark with a page, an ontology with the types it provides.
You see a relation as a **folder of files**, like any folder: choose *Open related...* in the context menu of a file, pick the kind of relation, and
a window opens that has one file for each relation.

### A relation file stands for the file it points to

The files in such a window are **placeholders** for the files at the end of the relations. They show the details of the relation in their columns
(the label, the page of a reference, ...), but they *represent the other file*:

* **Double-click** opens the file that the relation points to, not the placeholder. The details of the relation come along: a reference to page 12 of a PDF opens the PDF at page 12.
* **Open related...** and **Open contained...** on a placeholder show what is related to, or contained in, the file that it points to.
* **Changing a column** of the placeholder (the label, for example) changes the relation itself.
* **Deleting** a placeholder removes the relation, not the file it points to. Dropping a file into the window adds a relation to it.

Some relations are read-only, e.g. what an ontology provides: you can look at them, but not change or remove them.

### Folders inside a relation window

A **folder** in a relation window is a relation of its own (a relation with several parts, an *n-ary* relation, e.g. a chapter with its sections). What you do with the folder
you do with that relation.

Soon: *New related...* on a relation, or on such a folder, will add another part to it (a binary relation becomes a relation of three files, and so on).

### Choosing the columns

In the **Attributes** menu, each kind of relation has its own list of columns. A relation window shows all of them at first. In the menu of the column titles (right click),
Shift+click keeps the menu open so that you can choose several in a row, and choosing the menu of a kind of relation selects all its columns.
